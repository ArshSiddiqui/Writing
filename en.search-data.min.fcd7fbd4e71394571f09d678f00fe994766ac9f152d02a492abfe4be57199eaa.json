I haven\u0026rsquo;t read very many books about war, WW1 included, so this was definitely a great introduction.\nThe story itself is based upon Hemingway\u0026rsquo;s time serving as an ambulance driver working for the Italian military, where he had met a nurse he\u0026rsquo;d fallen in love with. I won\u0026rsquo;t say much more nor how his tale differs from the book itself, but keeping that in mind made the book (and the twists and turns of the story itself) more interesting.\nOne thing I really enjoyed about the story was the nature of the characters in terms of the wider scope of the narrative. Deaths being both tragic and meaningless at the same time often came into the foray, and mingled with useless murder. Hearing individuals discuss and debate the virtues (namely the lack thereof) of their situations gave more of a \u0026ldquo;what is it good for\u0026rdquo; flavor to the story that I, for one, appreciated.\nThis is definitely a great book that I would highly recommend.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/ataleoftwocities/","title":"A Tale of Two Cities","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rA Tale of Two Cities\r#\rCharles Dickens\r#\rNovember 17, 2021\n5/5\nI bought this book on a whim about a year ago, but didn\u0026rsquo;t start reading it till not long ago. I was told by a good friend that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all that it was chopped up to be, so I went in with little thought.\nI will say that the book began kind of slowly, but I enjoyed it all the same. At the halfway point, when the French Revolution begins is when the book really picks up steam, and it was at this point when I could not put the book down.\nPotential spoilers following\nSitting in history class learning about the French Revolution and the horrors of the Rein of Terror is one thing for certain. It is easy to throw around statistics of deaths of the time, but using statistics to represent deaths is unfair in some sense. This book really made me feel for all those lives lost and families unnecessarily impacted by the Revolution. The final chapter, and the final few paragraphs are truly something to behold, and left me a little sad I daresay.\nI highly recommend this read, it is a great book, there is no doubt about that in my mind.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/deathofasalesman/","title":"Death of a Salesman","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rDeath of a Salesman\r#\rArthur Miller\r#\rMarch 14, 2022\n5/5\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read only one of Miller\u0026rsquo;s books in the past, The Crucible, which was, of course, a fantastic novel. I\u0026rsquo;d heard of this book around the time I was reading that and it was described as one of the best American plays. I\u0026rsquo;ve finally gotten around to reading it and I can certainly agree with that claim.\nI think that a lot of us, or at least me, spend a lot of time and hope that we will go on to be successful in some way or another in our lives, and we put a lot of thought into it. I try to convince myself that it\u0026rsquo;s both hard to measure success and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to be successful, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to rewire my brain like that.\nThis novel certainly echoes a lot of the inner monologue I had going on for a while, and it was both comforting and terrifying to read about it in the novel. The novel describes the story of one man\u0026rsquo;s life, his trials and tribulations, and his frustrations all in one day. Reading it all out like that certainly gave me a lot to think about my life, and what I saw for myself in the future. Though, to be frank, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what to think about my life or existence.\nThe book is a great read, and it is a fantastic description of a human life in the modern day.

The other is of an older very simple man who can talk to cats. Both stories are great and engaging, but the story of the student didn\u0026rsquo;t play too well with me. At some times I really enjoyed reading about his aspects and became captivated by the progression of his stories. But at other times, it felt kind of slow and not really in my wheelhouse. The story of the older man though I really loved. I found his story to be really captivating and engaging, and I really enjoyed how he was written across the book. Additionally, his story became more interesting and engaging as the novel progressed. So too did the other story, but there were moments for me that were detracting. Certain parts of the students story felt unnecessary to me.\nI think that I need to read this book again. It clearly feels like a good book, but I came out of it a bit mixed.\nI think this would be a great book for someone with the right headspace, though I\u0026rsquo;m not sure when or if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever be there.\nThanks!\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/murderontheorientexpress/","title":"Murder on the Orient Express","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rMurder on the Orient Express\r#\rAgatha Christie\r#\rNovember 27, 2021\n5/5\nThe interesting thing about my reading schedule lately has been that I have been alternating between classic novels and Christie novels. I am a fairly slow reader so it\u0026rsquo;s always fun going from reading something like Don Quixote (which I greatly enjoyed but took me a good bit of months to read) to Christie\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;And Then There were None\u0026rdquo;, which I read in about two days and could not put down.\nI effectively had the same experience here, where before this, I was reading \u0026ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities\u0026rdquo;, by Charles Dickens, and then took a break from classic lit with some Christie. Again, this novel was spectacular; it was a novel I could not put down. The story is fascinating and I absolutely adore the setting of the plot (makes me wish trains were more ubiquitous in the USA). It is always a joy to read Christie and especially her stories with Poirot, and this is no exception.\nOne thing I would mention that is a bit out of the ordinary from the detective fiction I\u0026rsquo;ve read is the way this novel is set up. It isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily set up in the same vein as other detective fiction, but is rather broken down into a few sections: the case itself, meeting the passengers/dealing with evidence, and the ending. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen both the film adaptations of this novel, so actually reading it in this format (and with this set up) was rather interesting, though it does make sense from a deductive standpoint, I reckon.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this novel as I got great enjoyment out of it, but I do understand that the set up/progression of the novel could be a bit off putting to some.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/newyorkstories/","title":"New York Stories","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rNew York Stories\r#\rDiana Secker Tesdell (Editor)\r#\rJanuary 12, 2023\n5/5\nFantastic collection of stories, most if not all were a tremendous read and I found some really interesting authors that I\u0026rsquo;d definitely like to do more research into.\nSome of the stories felt very cozy and relaxed (\u0026ldquo;A Snowy Night on West-Forty Ninth Street\u0026rdquo; for example), others had a really captivating story that was hard to put down (like \u0026ldquo;Sonny\u0026rsquo;s Blues\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Negocios\u0026rdquo;).\nOverall a very enjoyable collection of short stories that are pleasant to quickly pick up and read.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/paris/","title":"Paris","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rParis\r#\rEdward Rutherford\r#\rJune 1, 2022\n5/5\nThis is a book that I have read a good many times in my life, but it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I last read it and I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet reviewed it so I figured that I\u0026rsquo;d give it a go.\nThis book discusses the history of Paris over about 1000 years (I think) through the perspectives of many different families of different upbringings, stories, and political perspectives. I find this very concept quite fascinating. It allows you to make your own character, put them in a turbulent time in history and just see what happens. The way families change (or don\u0026rsquo;t change) is nice to see, and this sort of character development is interesting in a historical perspective.\nI really enjoyed this novel, but I can see understand a lot of the arguments for issues within it. The book does have a lot of random historical facts and explanations, which do come up incredibly frequently (like every other paragraph). I can understand why someone would find this to really take you out of the story, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really ever an issue for me.\nI have found this book to be effectively a comforting read for me, and every time I\u0026rsquo;ve read it, I notice, or learn, something new. I quite liked the book, and I recommend you read it if you are interested in the history of Paris or want a nice read that you could get something out of.

Sure, I have read a fair bit of poetry since then, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t really taken the time to analyze it like I used to.\nOverall, this book was enjoyable. There were certainly poems I enjoyed, and the book did introduce me to Rainer Maria Rilke\u0026rsquo;s work, which I will certainly have to read more in the future, but there were also poems I just read for the sake of completion. While poems are certainly quite subjective, and I understand that my tastes may not match everyone else\u0026rsquo;s, I am still not a fan of having to churn through writing. Still though, of the poems I enjoyed, they were fantastically descriptive and lovely to read. I imagine that on a second read through of this book, I will feel more kindly to it (this isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that I hate it now - I don\u0026rsquo;t, I did enjoy it).\nOn the plus side, this is a book of poems, each one isn\u0026rsquo;t related to the other like a story (of course), so you can skip the one\u0026rsquo;s you do not like. You can read it at your leisure or at a very slow pace, even more so than with other books.\nI imagine that the best case reading scenario of this book would be to read it while on vacation in Rome. I googled many of the locations listed so I could understand what they looked like as I read it, but I imagine that reading each poem in their listed location would be far more gratifying than reading it in bed, like I did.\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes Rome (or is currently in Rome, be it living there or just visiting), maybe they have never been or perhaps they just want to visit it on a night in at home, or to anybody who is interested in Roman history, and would like to go more into depth in the literary history of it.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/writing/oldwriting/realprogrammersusegmail/","title":"Real Programmers Use Gmail","section":"Old Writing","content":"\rReal Programmers Use Gmail\r#\rI was recently having a conversation with a good friend of mine from the university. We were both students of the computer, or Computer Science majors as most people knew us by. During this conversation, I happened upon a question then that did intrigue me greatly: “What do you use to code?”.\nSee, this programmer (along with many others at my school) happen to use the IDE (the meaning of which doesn’t matter, but I DuckDuckGoed it, and it means Integrated Development Environment if you really care) of Eclipse.\nNow, I understand that the use of Eclipse is quite common among many programmers, and so too are many other IDEs, like Microsoft Visual Studio and WebStorm. However, I simply cannot allow the glorious realm of Computer Science to continue to stray down such a dark and gloomy and sad and disgusting and distressing and disappointing and path.\nI believe that IDEs are the mark of an inferior programmer, and only true programmers would use a system like Gmail to complete their code. There are many other ways of coding that I do find acceptable, like YouTube comments to private videos published by yourself or even by writing the code directly onto unlined and ungridded Tomoe River Paper using a Mont Blanc fountain pen containing the ink of various goats sacrificed to Steve Zuckerberg, but Gmail is a far more accessible and more efficient tool.\nTo explain my use of Gmail, I find it helpful to go through how I code, starting from the beginning.\nI begin with a cup of coffee, black preferably (because black coffee, as it does provide a taste much like dirt, allows me to regain my sense of feeling as a programmer), before sitting down in my gamer chair preparing myself to code. I use a gamer chair, because it is the only chair that can handle the strong and strenuous movements of anger and frustration I make when coding. To match my chair I have a Logitech G PRO Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Ultra Portable Tenkeyless Design, Detachable Micro USB Cable, 16.8 Million Color LIGHTSYNC RGB Backlit Keys (4.7 out of 5 stars, 1157 ratings), only the necessities.\nI then turn on my computer and enter “gmail.com” into the DuckDuckGo search bar. After providing my c\nredentials, I click on the compose button, but not after bragging to you (the reader), about my 17,345 unread emails (much of which is code previously created on Gmail). In the email construction box, I make sure that I put my own email address (GmailProgrammer4EVA2234@gmail.com) in the “To” section, to ensure that it goes to me, not to anybody else. In the subject line, I leave it blank, because I don’t have time to write out a subject line, I’m a busy programmer after all! After this, I generally find myself coffee-ed out, and so I take some of my caffeine pills (prescribed to me by me, not my doctor, because I don’t have the time to see doctors, I’m a busy programmer after all!) and pop about 5 pills into a bottle of water, and another 5 directly into my mouth, so as to chew them.\nThen I can finally begin to code, all within the text field, but sometimes, if I really feel like taking my programming prowess to the next level, I convert all of my paragraphs of code into one line and stick it in the subject field. This is a major feat within the world of computing, and so I make sure to additionally send an email with this subject line to my boss, with the additional message “Coming for your job next!!!1!11!1!”. When doing this, do make sure to consume as much caffeine as possible, as you don’t want to get tired whilst doing all that coding!\nAfter my work is done, I close my computer, before heading back to my kitchen to make another (well deserved) cup of black coffee.\nWhile it may seem like a lot of work, this is the true method of programming, and I hope that some of you lowly IDE programmers choose to enlighten yourselves and join me on this path.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/romeoandjulliet/","title":"Romeo and Julliet","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rRomeo and Julliet\r#\rWilliam Shakespeare\r#\rFebruary 19, 2022\n4/5\nGiven the many varying reviews of this novel that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen here, I was curious to see what I\u0026rsquo;d think of it after having finished reading the story. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know a lot about the story beforehand (besides whatever is in the public consciousness), and it\u0026rsquo;d taken me long enough to get round to the book, so I dived right on it.\nSome slight spoilers ahead.\nOverall, I enjoyed the book. The main downside I found in the book was the unbelievableness in some aspects of the story, like how excessively quickly Romeo and Juliet decided they loved each other, and things along those lines. I figured, after reading such things as that, that I would find the book unfavorable, mostly in how quickly an attempt was made to push the two together, but I found that Shakespeare did it fantastically and made the whole idea seem reasonable.\nMany facets of the book were absolutely lovely to read. Going in, I was sure that I would have trouble understanding what was going on, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t that bad at all, the writing and speech do become rather melodic. The famous scenes of when Romeo first meets Juliet and when he speaks to her from her window were absolutely fantastic example of how nice the speech was to read. Their individual lines flowing from one character to another was done with such cleanliness that I genuinely felt the need to read it out loud, so as to get a better experience of the writing.\nI highly recommend this book to pretty much any reader. There is a reason it is so famous and it is an absolute delight to read.

Sometimes when looking at stock data, or when visualizing it, we may want to smooth out the data so that we can avoid shifted perceptions due to temporary changes in stock valuation. This may offer us a more comprehensive look at our data, that is not skewed by any minor blip.\nWe can change the duration of the rolling average, based upon how much smoothing we may want. For example, we could have a shorter smoothing of just 20 days, or longer smoothing of 100 days.\nBefore I did that, though, I first had to reindex my data. Because financial data is collected on weekdays, I had to account for that fact by adding in all of the non-included days in our data between the start and end dates we provided. We can fill these empty spots in with na and then we can reindex those to copy the previously entered piece of data into that box.\nimport pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt close = panel_data[\u0026#39;Close\u0026#39;] all_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq=\u0026#39;B\u0026#39;) close = close.reindex(all_weekdays) close = close.fillna(method=\u0026#39;ffill\u0026#39;) short_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=20).mean() long_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=100).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days rolling\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days rolling\u0026#39;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() When developing a stock strategy, or trading strategy, we will want to analyze the change in the returns of our stock over time. One way to do this would be to look at relative returns. A relative return is the amount of return our stock will get after some timeline relative to some benchmark return. The formula for relative returns looks as follows.\n\\[\rr_{relative}(t) = \\frac{p(t) - p(t - 1)}{p(t - 1)}\r\\]\rAnother way to do this would be through logarithmic returns, the formula which is as follows.\n\\[\rr(t) = log(\\frac{p(t)}{p(t - 1)})\r\\]\rThere are many reasons why we may wish to use a log return, rather than relative returns, some of which would be that they capture the compounding effect. When we consider that financial investments such as these are compounded over many points in time, we may find this compounding important to capture in our data, which make log returns more appealing in their use.\nimport numpy as np log_returns = np.log(close).diff() fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(16, 12)) ax1.plot(log_returns.index, log_returns.cumsum(), label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax1.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Cumulative log returns\u0026#39;) ax1.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax1.legend(loc=\u0026#39;upper left\u0026#39;) ax2.plot(log_returns.index, 100*(np.exp(log_returns.cumsum()) - 1), label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax2.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Total relative returns (%)\u0026#39;) ax2.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax2.legend(loc=\u0026#39;upper left\u0026#39;) plt.show() While analyzing our data visually is indeed very useful, it is also helpful to analyze our data quantitatively.

This method is evidently fairly easy to create, and shows us the general trend of our stock movement. Another method is known as the \u0026ldquo;exponential moving average\u0026rdquo; (EMA). This method of moving average places more importance/weight on more recent data points, so it accounts more strongly for recent changes in price.\nWith the EMA, we can also do it across a time period, perhaps 20 or even 100 days. Below I have graphed the regular stock price and both the EMA and SMA across 20 and 100 days, so as to easily see their differences.\nema_short = close.ewm(span = 20, adjust=False).mean() ema_long = close.ewm(span = 100, adjust=False).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(ema_short.index, ema_short, label=\u0026#34;20 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.plot(ema_long.index, ema_long, label=\u0026#34;100 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() Before making any investment it is critical to know the volatility of a stock, as it can give us insight into how risky the stock may be as an investment. Volatility measures how dispersed, or spread out, the returns for our stock is. Thus, the greater the volatility is, the riskier of an investment it would be. It can be calculated as the standard deviation between returns of the stock.

I discovered this book, mostly through its book cover, which was designed by the fantastic Peter Mendelsund. I happened to find the blurb on the book really interesting, and wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find much about it online, outside of some book reviews. Which immediately made me interested.\nThe book is rather not that long, and many of the \u0026ldquo;chapters\u0026rdquo; are less than a page long. I say \u0026ldquo;chapter\u0026rdquo;, because the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have chapters in its normal sense, in fact, they are rather more like broken up processes of thought or a change in viewpoints.\nThe prose is wonderful, and I frequently found myself very comforted by the way that Énard writes. It is a form of writing that I cannot describe, or truly give any life to, but it was fantastic. To me, it really captured a sense of calm and peace, which when mixed with the setting of Constantinople, really made me feel at home. I have not felt this relaxed when reading a novel in a long time.\n(Potential spoilers ahead.) The only downside to this book in my mind is the ending, which I found to be a bit sudden, unexpected, and blocky. It may be perfectly acceptable to some, but I found it a bit too jarring when compared to the rest of the book.\nOverall, I found this to be an absolutely fantastic and lovely book, with a few chips in the glaze. I would recommend this strongly to anybody who wants a calming, relaxing book that is quite thoughtful nonetheless. I look forward to reading more from Mathias Énard in the future!\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/thecountofmontecristo/","title":"The Count of Monte Cristo","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Count of Monte Cristo\r#\rAlexandre Dumas\r#\rAugust 5, 2021\n5/5\nFor a while now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been continuously hearing people rave about this book, describing it as thrilling and exciting. And that\u0026rsquo;s coming from people who aren\u0026rsquo;t even that into classical literature as some others may be. After finishing the book, I can certainly agree with that sentiment.\nWithout laying too much on the line, this book deals a lot with vengeance, and slow, critically aimed vengeance at that, which left me continuously wanting to see what would happen next. This point in it self is enough to satisfy thriller enthusiasts, but to even those that prefer more thought provoking stories, I would say this book is up to par still.\nWith books like these, I don\u0026rsquo;t just. want an exciting rush through a story , but I do want something I can perhaps also put some contemplation, or thinking, into, and this book has also satiated that desire. Though much of the book is thrilleresque and speedy, there are certainly some moments that lead me to slow down a bit and consider our hero\u0026rsquo;s situation and the situation of others. There were also a lot of moments that would lead me to consider what could cause me to \u0026ldquo;break\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;go bad\u0026rdquo; for personal gain. in a sense.\nWith the way this book is set up, I think that almost anyone could get into the story, from classical purists to those that adore YA.\nOverall, this book is an exciting yet contemplative story that I would recommend almost anyone to read, and I daresay that I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll like it!.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/theeleganceofthehedgehog/","title":"The Elegance of the Hedgehog","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Elegance of the Hedgehog\r#\rMuriel Barbery\r#\rAugust 19, 2022\n1.5/5\nThere are many reasons why this book is not enjoyable, and many folks have already given many reasons to that effect, but for me it was mostly the characters and one passage in particular (which gave me reason to doubt a lot of the book).\nFirstly, the characters are not great. One is a concierge named Renee, who does not wish for the rich people living in the building she works at to discover she has read a couple Dostoevskys and understands some Wikipedia articles on philosophy. She believes that she needs to present herself as ignorant and stupid, so that nobody inquires into her. This genuinely makes no sense to me (even when the reason for her actions are explained later in the book). I cannot comprehend how anybody would think that other people would care for the fact that you can read. No rich person gives two hoots of a whistle that you have read big books in the past, and the fact that the character genuinely believes that this information could ruin her life is ridiculous.\nThe other character is a young girl named Paloma, who lives in the same building and wants to kill herself and burn down the building. Fantastic. She is also supposedly quite smart and spends the entire book trying to find a meaning to live on. She also feels the need to hide her intelligence from her family (and her sister in particular), again for no reason really.\nI can understand that irritating characters don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make a book bad, but these two people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have any logical reasoning behind their actions, which frustrated me to no end throughout my reading.\nSecondly, there is a passage in the book that goes as follows:\n\u0026ldquo;When we Westerners walk, our culture dictates that we must, through the continuity of a movement we envision as smooth and seamless, try to restore what we take to be the very essence of life: efficiency without obstacles, a fluid performance that, being free of interruption, will represent the vital élan thanks to which all will be realized. For us the standard is the cheetah in action: all his movements fuse together harmoniously, one cannot be distinguished from the next, and the swift passage of the great wild animal seems like one long continuous movement symbolizing the deep perfection of life. When a J apanese woman disrupts the powerful sequence of natural movement with her jerky little steps, we ought to experience the disquiet that troubles our soul whenever nature is violated in this way, but in fact we are filled with a unfamiliar blissfulness, as if disruption could lead to a sort of ecstasy, and a grain of sand to beauty. What we discover in this affront to the sacred rhythm of life, this defiant movement of little feet, this excellence born of constraint, is a paradigm of Art.\u0026rdquo;\nNow a lot of this book touches on psychology and philosophy, things that I find interesting, but really don\u0026rsquo;t understand or have any fundamental knowledge in. But this passage did tread on some knowledge that I do have, walking (as it feels adjacent to flaneur). Given that, this entire passage made genuinely no sense to me, and did not logically connect.\nFirstly, the passage begins by attacking the western mode of walking, apparently we all walk \u0026ldquo;smooth and seamless\u0026rdquo;, because we all want to be efficient and fast. That is patently ridiculous. The flaneur (the very antithesis to this form of walking attributed to westerners) was born in the west, and in Paris for that matter! The very city this book takes place in. Also this is conflating all westerners together. You can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that someone from Waco, Texas walks the same as someone from New York City or someone from London.\nWhile this seems like something really stupid to complain about, this very discussion of walking appears to me to be a way that the author wants to critique western life (or modern western life), in that through our mode of walking, one can determine that we are all people that want efficiency, smoothness, and speed in our lives. This is, of course, false. Barbery appears to imagine that all westerners work at places like Wall Street and continuously name drop \u0026ldquo;the grindset\u0026rdquo; whilst chugging a Starbucks latte.\nThis form of walking is then juxtaposed with the Japanese form, which she describes as \u0026ldquo;jerky\u0026rdquo;, and is thus an \u0026ldquo;affront to the sacred rhythm of life\u0026rdquo;, because it isn\u0026rsquo;t smooth or fast. That also sounds absurd and over generalizes Japan the same way it did with the west previously. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine that businessmen in Tokyo may fit the author\u0026rsquo;s previous complaint on western walking, while someone in a smaller town would not. This phase of the passage was also incredibly uncomfortable to read, at least for me.\nThis may not seem like a lot, and perhaps I am making a mountain out of a mole hill, but what it revealed to me is that on a single passage in which I had some very minimal knowledge on the background discussion, I could notice countless flaws that made the passage make no sense to me. That made me wonder how many more errors of this kind were present in the mass bulk of the novel, especially in areas I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand? Probably a lot, and reading some of the other reviews, I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be too far off in that thought.\nOverall, this book was not very good. I went into the book thinking that, and it was reaffirmed, but I did have some fun with how ridiculous some passages and thoughts were.\nI can understand why some people may like this book, it is interesting in some regards, and the ending was better then the beginning and middle, so all I can suggest is to maybe read this.\nThanks!\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/theforest/","title":"The Forest","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Forest\r#\rEdward Rutherfurd\r#\rFebruary 16, 2023\n4.5/5\nI have only read one other novel by Edward Rutherford, \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo;, which has become one of my favorite books and one that I go back to reasonably often. I bought this book quite a long while ago, but didn\u0026rsquo;t finish it the first time around, giving it another shot though was absolutely a great idea.\nThis book was an incredibly engaging historical sequence and story of a couple different old families of the New Forest region in southern England. Unlike \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo;, which quite often jumped back and forth in time and between stories of families, \u0026ldquo;The Forest\u0026rdquo; went through each time period chapter by chapter, causing a more fluid story in some sense. One other interesting difference was how \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo; appeared to have a primary story/timeline one followed (late 1800s to the early 1900s), however, \u0026ldquo;The Forest\u0026rdquo; does not have this. Each time period is important and engaging in its own way, and each former time period would be recalled and regaled in later chapters in some way.\nThe one common downside of Edward Rutherford books is that there are very often phases of the story that feel incredibly clunky, which is in part due to the massive amounts of factual information being provided. If I recall correctly, in the first chapter, there was a few page long discussion of trees in the New Forest, and while it was certainly interesting, it felt a little bit out of place compared to the story that was just taking place. In this sense, the fact delivery nature of the novels can be clunky, but really I\u0026rsquo;ve read no other author\u0026rsquo;s work that can handle it very smoothly. In some sense, it feels like a hazard of the trade.\nEach chapter was very engaging and fun, and I often felt sad at leaving the characters I had finally grown accustomed to in the last chapter to sally forth and read about their descendants. I highly recommend this book both for its story and its historical delivery.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/themanwhodiedtwice/","title":"The Man Who Died Twice","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Man Who Died Twice\r#\rRichard Osman\r#\rJune 26, 2022\n5/5\nThis was a genuinely lovely read. I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether I more so consider it to be a mystery or comedy, but it is certainly a bit of both. There were moments reading it where I genuinely laughed out loud, and that hardly happens to me with books, so that was a lovely surprise. This book is a bit more of a quicker read compared to some of the others that I\u0026rsquo;ve read, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably due to the subject matter, and the speed with which I read mystery novels.\nThere were a few gripes I do have with the novel, two in fact. Firstly, a lot of the intrigue happens a bit late in the book, so I found myself reading somewhat slowly for the first two thirds of the book, and the speeding it and the last mark. This is, of course, expected (especially for a mystery novel), but I felt the balance was a bit skewed. This hardly impacted my enjoyment of the novel though. Secondly, there were a lot of moments were you could mistake our septuagenarians for being more middle aged, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bothered by this either.\nOverall this was a fantastic and fun read, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend you read it if you want to try something a little lighthearted, and funny all the same!\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/themayorofcasterbridge/","title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Mayor of Casterbridge\r#\rThomas Hardy\r#\rFebryary 5, 2022\n5/5\nSome potential spoilers ahead.\nAs with most classics, The Mayor of Casterbridge took me a while to read. The first half took a good few weeks, but the second half was finished rather quickly.\nI recall reading something in the preface/note that mentioned that Henchard was not a bad man, but that he is hot-tempered. It was hard, for much of the novel, for me to understand why that statement was true, why it was the case, but I seemed to then have forgotten something I recall now, that people can change. This novel is the greatest example of the complexity of humans that I have thus far read. This book is very effective in showing that we are not 1 dimensional beings with a set of non-malleable characteristics.\nThe full title of this novel, \u0026ldquo;The Mayor of Casterbridge: A Story of a Man of Character\u0026rdquo;, really fits the theme of the story. What does it mean \u0026ldquo;to have character\u0026rdquo;? I\u0026rsquo;ve done some quick Googling, but have gotten many different answers: moral excellence and firmness or being able to deal well with difficult situations. However, the best definitions, to me at least, discuss individuality, and how \u0026ldquo;character\u0026rdquo; just means the sum of our traits. This means that you can have good character or bad character, they can all fall under the same label, at least I suppose so (I\u0026rsquo;m not a linguist, nor am I good at English).\nTo describe Henchard as a \u0026ldquo;man of character\u0026rdquo; is fitting to me, though with the definition I have given, it fits all of us wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it? I like how ambiguous this phrase is, though. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell us much, then, about Henchard, but effectively that he is just a person, like any of us. In that way, I guess we can all perhaps see at least some of ourselves in Henchard (or maybe I just have problems that need to be resolved).\nForgive me for these poorly written ramblings. I have no qualifications in reading or writing, I just enjoy thinking about it.\nThe book is fantastic, and if you want to read a story with characters that are just as complex, confusing, and contrary to their own nature as real people are, then I would give this novel a read.

They are rather big consequences, and they are interesting considerations. I actually learned of Nikolai Gogol first through those consequences, through an article by the New Yorker.\nThe stories themselves were very charming otherwise, and often very humorous.

That does not necessarily make it any better, but it is something to be noted. Mostly that I have spent most of my time recently reading classics and mystery novels, so a historical fiction novel (which is interest-wise down my alley) would have likely been a different read to begin with.\nOverall, I enjoyed the book. It was a fantastic story that captured me for its duration. I read it quicker that most other books and could not put it down at many intervals. The story is that of a mystery in my mind, which could explain my enjoyment of it. But it does also wonderfully employ its characters to plot progression and does develop them to good effect throughout the book. It was moving and I can certainly recommend that anybody pick it up. If none of that made sense, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to forgive me - I am not great at reviewing books (if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear enough).\nWarning - some slight spoilers in the next paragraph.\nThe book does have some faults though. Without giving too much spoilers away, some things occurred throughout the novel and some characters became important rather suddenly. Which is fine, but does rather catch you off guard when comparing it to the rest of the story.\nOverall, this was a fun read and while I did not get much personally out of the book (at least as of this reading), I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anybody looking for an escapist novel or an overall fun and enjoyable novel.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/utopia/","title":"Utopia","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rUtopia\r#\rThomas More\r#\rJune 14, 2022\n4/5\nUtopia is a satirical novel on English politics of the time period, at least I reckon. It describes one man\u0026rsquo;s experience with a \u0026ldquo;Utopian land\u0026rdquo; and goes into detail about life and the inhabitants of the island.\nI find this to be overall a great book, I found that the format of the novel (between the first half which was more of a discussion of the troubles with English politics at the time, and the second half which focused solely on Utopia and its state of affairs) to be generally quite good as a discussion of \u0026ldquo;Utopia\u0026rdquo; and as a comparison to human-like life and politics.\nThis book is a satire, though I must say that after finishing it, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really find many satirical elements to it, but that would probably be because I\u0026rsquo;m not a great reader, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really analyze/delve into the book (or the author\u0026rsquo;s time period), and my frame of reference going into the book may have not been the best. However, this novel certainly is still very impactful, relevant, and important regardless of whether one can or can\u0026rsquo;t experience the satirical elements throughout.\nI would recommend that one read this book, I found it quite good, and it really is a fascinating read, experiencing another\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint of the world. Asking a person, especially one so educated as Sir Thomas Moore, about what they would see a perfect world to be down to the distribution of food, is interesting, and can paint a great image of the world that the author lived in at the time.\nBased on that, I think that anybody who wants to learn more about politics (the history of politics in particular I\u0026rsquo;d guess) may find this book quite interesting.\nThanks for reading!\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/victory/","title":"Victory","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rVictory\r#\rJoseph Conrad\r#\rDecember 21, 2022\n3/5\nThis book took me a long time to read, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t its fault, though, more of mine.\nI\u0026rsquo;d say the book was pretty good, albeit a little bit slow for my tastes throughout much of the beginning and middle of the book.\nThe ending was absolutely fantastic and when a lot of the writing really came through and shone for me.\nThe setting and description of place that highlighted certain scenes and acts in the story were done fantastically, and did help me lose myself in the plot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, I reckon I should read it again sometime in the future.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/writing/docs/aboutme/","title":"About Me","section":"Docs","content":"Hello, my name is Arsh Siddiqui.\nThis website contains a portfolio of my writing.\nHopefully you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it\u0026hellip;\nThanks for coming along!\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/","title":"Book Reviews","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rBook Reviews\r#\rAll of my book reviews, these are adapted from my Goodreads.
