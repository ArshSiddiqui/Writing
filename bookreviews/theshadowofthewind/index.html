I found this book far easier to read than many of the previous books I&rsquo;d finished. That does not necessarily make it any better, but it is something to be noted. Mostly that I have spent most of my time recently reading classics and mystery novels, so a historical fiction novel (which is interest-wise down my alley) would have likely been a different read to begin with.">

<p>4/5</p>
<p>I found this book far easier to read than many of the previous books I&rsquo;d finished. That does not necessarily
make it any better, but it is something to be noted. Mostly that I have spent most of my time recently reading
classics and mystery novels, so a historical fiction novel (which is interest-wise down my alley) would have
likely been a different read to begin with.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. It was a fantastic story that captured me for its duration. I read it quicker
that most other books and could not put it down at many intervals. The story is that of a mystery in my mind,
which could explain my enjoyment of it. But it does also wonderfully employ its characters to plot progression
and does develop them to good effect throughout the book. It was moving and I can certainly recommend that
anybody pick it up. If none of that made sense, you&rsquo;ll have to forgive me - I am not great at reviewing
books (if that wasn&rsquo;t clear enough).</p>
<p><strong>Warning - some slight spoilers in the next paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>The book does have some faults though. Without giving too much spoilers away, some things occurred throughout
the novel and some characters became important rather suddenly. Which is fine, but does rather catch you off
guard when comparing it to the rest of the story.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a fun read and while I did not get much personally out of the book (at least as of this
reading), I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anybody looking for an escapist novel or an overall fun and
enjoyable novel.</p>
