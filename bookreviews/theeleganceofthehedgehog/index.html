<p><em>August 19, 2022</em></p>
<p>1.5/5</p>
<p>There are many reasons why this book is not enjoyable, and many folks have already given many reasons
to that effect, but for me it was mostly the characters and one passage in particular (which gave me
reason to doubt a lot of the book).</p>
<p>Firstly, the characters are not great. One is a concierge named Renee, who does not wish for the rich
people living in the building she works at to discover she has read a couple Dostoevskys and understands
some Wikipedia articles on philosophy. She believes that she needs to present herself as ignorant and
stupid, so that nobody inquires into her. This genuinely makes no sense to me (even when the reason for
her actions are explained later in the book). I cannot comprehend how anybody would think that other
people would care for the fact that you can read. No rich person gives two hoots of a whistle that
you have read big books in the past, and the fact that the character genuinely believes that this
information could ruin her life is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The other character is a young girl named Paloma, who lives in the same building and wants to kill
herself and burn down the building. Fantastic. She is also supposedly quite smart and spends the entire
book trying to find a meaning to live on. She also feels the need to hide her intelligence from her
family (and her sister in particular), again for no reason really.</p>
<p>I can understand that irritating characters don&rsquo;t necessarily make a book bad, but these two people
don&rsquo;t seem to have any logical reasoning behind their actions, which frustrated me to no end throughout
my reading.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a passage in the book that goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When we Westerners walk, our culture dictates that we must, through the continuity of a movement we
envision as smooth and seamless, try to restore what we take to be the very essence of life: efficiency
without obstacles, a fluid performance that, being free of interruption, will represent the vital Ã©lan
thanks to which all will be realized. For us the standard is the cheetah in action: all his movements
fuse together harmoniously, one cannot be distinguished from the next, and the swift passage of the great
wild animal seems like one long continuous movement symbolizing the deep perfection of life. When a J
apanese woman disrupts the powerful sequence of natural movement with her jerky little steps, we ought
to experience the disquiet that troubles our soul whenever nature is violated in this way, but in fact
we are filled with a unfamiliar blissfulness, as if disruption could lead to a sort of ecstasy, and a
grain of sand to beauty. What we discover in this affront to the sacred rhythm of life, this defiant
movement of little feet, this excellence born of constraint, is a paradigm of Art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now a lot of this book touches on psychology and philosophy, things that I find interesting, but really
don&rsquo;t understand or have any fundamental knowledge in. But this passage did tread on some knowledge
that I do have, walking (as it feels adjacent to flaneur). Given that, this entire passage made genuinely
no sense to me, and did not logically connect.</p>
<p>Firstly, the passage begins by attacking the western mode of walking, apparently we all walk &ldquo;smooth
and seamless&rdquo;, because we all want to be efficient and fast. That is patently ridiculous. The flaneur
(the very antithesis to this form of walking attributed to westerners) was born in the west, and in Paris
for that matter! The very city this book takes place in. Also this is conflating all westerners together.
You can&rsquo;t imagine that someone from Waco, Texas walks the same as someone from New York City or someone
from London.</p>
<p>While this seems like something really stupid to complain about, this very discussion of walking appears to me
to be a way that the author wants to critique western life (or modern western life), in that through our mode
of walking, one can determine that we are all people that want efficiency, smoothness, and speed in our lives.
This is, of course, false. Barbery appears to imagine that all westerners work at places like Wall Street and
continuously name drop &ldquo;the grindset&rdquo; whilst chugging a Starbucks latte.</p>
<p>This form of walking is then juxtaposed with the Japanese form, which she describes as &ldquo;jerky&rdquo;, and is thus
an &ldquo;affront to the sacred rhythm of life&rdquo;, because it isn&rsquo;t smooth or fast. That also sounds absurd and over
generalizes Japan the same way it did with the west previously. I&rsquo;d imagine that businessmen in Tokyo may fit
the author&rsquo;s previous complaint on western walking, while someone in a smaller town would not. This phase of
the passage was also incredibly uncomfortable to read, at least for me.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a lot, and perhaps I am making a mountain out of a mole hill, but what it revealed to
me is that on a single passage in which I had some very minimal knowledge on the background discussion, I
could notice countless flaws that made the passage make no sense to me. That made me wonder how many more
errors of this kind were present in the mass bulk of the novel, especially in areas I didn&rsquo;t understand?
Probably a lot, and reading some of the other reviews, I don&rsquo;t seem to be too far off in that thought.</p>
<p>Overall, this book was not very good. I went into the book thinking that, and it was reaffirmed, but I did
have some fun with how ridiculous some passages and thoughts were.</p>
<p>I can understand why some people may like this book, it is interesting in some regards, and the ending was
better then the beginning and middle, so all I can suggest is to maybe read this.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
