<p>4/5</p>
<p>Given the many varying reviews of this novel that I&rsquo;ve seen here, I was curious to see what I&rsquo;d think of it
after having finished reading the story. I didn&rsquo;t know a lot about the story beforehand (besides whatever is
in the public consciousness), and it&rsquo;d taken me long enough to get round to the book, so I dived right on it.</p>
<p><strong>Some slight spoilers ahead.</strong></p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The main downside I found in the book was the unbelievableness in some aspects
of the story, like how excessively quickly Romeo and Juliet decided they loved each other, and things along
those lines. I figured, after reading such things as that, that I would find the book unfavorable, mostly in
how quickly an attempt was made to push the two together, but I found that Shakespeare did it fantastically and
made the whole idea seem reasonable.</p>
<p>Many facets of the book were absolutely lovely to read. Going in, I was sure that I would have trouble
understanding what was going on, but it really isn&rsquo;t that bad at all, the writing and speech do become
rather melodic. The famous scenes of when Romeo first meets Juliet and when he speaks to her from her
window were absolutely fantastic example of how nice the speech was to read. Their individual lines flowing
from one character to another was done with such cleanliness that I genuinely felt the need to read it out loud,
so as to get a better experience of the writing.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book to pretty much any reader. There is a reason it is so famous and it is an
absolute delight to read. Thank you!</p>
