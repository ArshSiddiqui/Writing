This was a genuinely lovely read. I don&rsquo;t know whether I more so consider it to be a mystery or comedy, but it is certainly a bit of both. There were moments reading it where I genuinely laughed out loud, and that hardly happens to me with books, so that was a lovely surprise. This book is a bit more of a quicker read compared to some of the others that I&rsquo;ve read, but that&rsquo;s probably due to the subject matter, and the speed with which I read mystery novels.">

<p>This was a genuinely lovely read. I don&rsquo;t know whether I more so consider it to be a mystery or
comedy, but it is certainly a bit of both. There were moments reading it where I genuinely laughed
out loud, and that hardly happens to me with books, so that was a lovely surprise. This book is a bit
more of a quicker read compared to some of the others that I&rsquo;ve read, but that&rsquo;s probably due to the
subject matter, and the speed with which I read mystery novels.</p>
<p>There were a few gripes I do have with the novel, two in fact. Firstly, a lot of the intrigue happens
a bit late in the book, so I found myself reading somewhat slowly for the first two thirds of the book,
and the speeding it and the last mark. This is, of course, expected (especially for a mystery novel),
but I felt the balance was a bit skewed. This hardly impacted my enjoyment of the novel though. Secondly,
there were a lot of moments were you could mistake our septuagenarians for being more middle aged, but I
wasn&rsquo;t too bothered by this either.</p>
<p>Overall this was a fantastic and fun read, I&rsquo;d recommend you read it if you want to try something a little
lighthearted, and funny all the same!</p>
