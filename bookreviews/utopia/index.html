Utopia is a satirical novel on English politics of the time period, at least I reckon. It describes one man&rsquo;s experience with a &ldquo;Utopian land&rdquo; and goes into detail about life and the inhabitants of the island.
I find this to be overall a great book, I found that the format of the novel (between the first half which was more of a discussion of the troubles with English politics at the time, and the second half which focused solely on Utopia and its state of affairs) to be generally quite good as a discussion of &ldquo;Utopia&rdquo; and as a comparison to human-like life and politics.">

<p>Utopia is a satirical novel on English politics of the time period, at least I reckon. It describes one
man&rsquo;s experience with a &ldquo;Utopian land&rdquo; and goes into detail about life and the inhabitants of the island.</p>
<p>I find this to be overall a great book, I found that the format of the novel (between the first half
which was more of a discussion of the troubles with English politics at the time, and the second half
which focused solely on Utopia and its state of affairs) to be generally quite good as a discussion of
&ldquo;Utopia&rdquo; and as a comparison to human-like life and politics.</p>
<p>This book is a satire, though I must say that after finishing it, I didn&rsquo;t really find many satirical
elements to it, but that would probably be because I&rsquo;m not a great reader, I didn&rsquo;t really analyze/delve
into the book (or the author&rsquo;s time period), and my frame of reference going into the book may have not
been the best. However, this novel certainly is still very impactful, relevant, and important regardless
of whether one can or can&rsquo;t experience the satirical elements throughout.</p>
<p>I would recommend that one read this book, I found it quite good, and it really is a fascinating read,
experiencing another&rsquo;s viewpoint of the world. Asking a person, especially one so educated as Sir Thomas
Moore, about what they would see a perfect world to be down to the distribution of food, is interesting,
and can paint a great image of the world that the author lived in at the time.</p>
<p>Based on that, I think that anybody who wants to learn more about politics (the history of politics
in particular I&rsquo;d guess) may find this book quite interesting.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
