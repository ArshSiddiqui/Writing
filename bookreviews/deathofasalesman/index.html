<p><em>March 14, 2022</em></p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read only one of Miller&rsquo;s books in the past, The Crucible, which was, of course, a fantastic novel.
I&rsquo;d heard of this book around the time I was reading that and it was described as one of the best American
plays. I&rsquo;ve finally gotten around to reading it and I can certainly agree with that claim.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of us, or at least me, spend a lot of time and hope that we will go on to be successful
in some way or another in our lives, and we put a lot of thought into it. I try to convince myself that it&rsquo;s
both hard to measure success and it&rsquo;s hard to be successful, but it&rsquo;s hard for me to rewire my brain like that.</p>
<p>This novel certainly echoes a lot of the inner monologue I had going on for a while, and it was both comforting
and terrifying to read about it in the novel. The novel describes the story of one man&rsquo;s life, his trials and
tribulations, and his frustrations all in one day. Reading it all out like that certainly gave me a lot to
think about my life, and what I saw for myself in the future. Though, to be frank, I don&rsquo;t really know what
to think about my life or existence.</p>
<p>The book is a great read, and it is a fantastic description of a human life in the modern day. I would
recommend that one read this book.</p>
