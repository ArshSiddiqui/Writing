For a while now, I&rsquo;ve been continuously hearing people rave about this book, describing it as thrilling and exciting. And that&rsquo;s coming from people who aren&rsquo;t even that into classical literature as some others may be. After finishing the book, I can certainly agree with that sentiment.
Without laying too much on the line, this book deals a lot with vengeance, and slow, critically aimed vengeance at that, which left me continuously wanting to see what would happen next.">

<p><em>August 5, 2021</em></p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>For a while now, I&rsquo;ve been continuously hearing people rave about this book, describing it as thrilling
and exciting. And that&rsquo;s coming from people who aren&rsquo;t even that into classical literature as some others
may be. After finishing the book, I can certainly agree with that sentiment.</p>
<p>Without laying too much on the line, this book deals a lot with vengeance, and slow, critically aimed vengeance
at that, which left me continuously wanting to see what would happen next. This point in it self is enough to
satisfy thriller enthusiasts, but to even those that prefer more thought provoking stories, I would say this
book is up to par still.</p>
<p>With books like these, I don&rsquo;t just. want an exciting rush through a story , but I do want something I can
perhaps also put some contemplation, or thinking, into, and this book has also satiated that desire. Though
much of the book is thrilleresque and speedy, there are certainly some moments that lead me to slow down a
bit and consider our hero&rsquo;s situation and the situation of others. There were also a lot of moments that would
lead me to consider what could cause me to &ldquo;break&rdquo;, or &ldquo;go bad&rdquo; for personal gain. in a sense.</p>
<p>With the way this book is set up, I think that almost anyone could get into the story, from classical purists
to those that adore YA.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is an exciting yet contemplative story that I would recommend almost anyone to read, and I
daresay that I hope you&rsquo;ll like it!.</p>
