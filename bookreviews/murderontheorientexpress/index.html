<p><em>November 27, 2021</em></p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>The interesting thing about my reading schedule lately has been that I have been alternating between classic
novels and Christie novels. I am a fairly slow reader so it&rsquo;s always fun going from reading something like Don
Quixote (which I greatly enjoyed but took me a good bit of months to read) to Christie&rsquo;s &ldquo;And Then There were
None&rdquo;, which I read in about two days and could not put down.</p>
<p>I effectively had the same experience here, where before this, I was reading &ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities&rdquo;, by Charles
Dickens, and then took a break from classic lit with some Christie. Again, this novel was spectacular; it was
a novel I could not put down. The story is fascinating and I absolutely adore the setting of the plot (makes me
wish trains were more ubiquitous in the USA). It is always a joy to read Christie and especially her stories
with Poirot, and this is no exception.</p>
<p>One thing I would mention that is a bit out of the ordinary from the detective fiction I&rsquo;ve read is the way
this novel is set up. It isn&rsquo;t necessarily set up in the same vein as other detective fiction, but is rather
broken down into a few sections: the case itself, meeting the passengers/dealing with evidence, and the ending.
I&rsquo;ve seen both the film adaptations of this novel, so actually reading it in this format (and with this set up)
was rather interesting, though it does make sense from a deductive standpoint, I reckon.</p>
<p>Overall, I would highly recommend this novel as I got great enjoyment out of it, but I do understand that the
set up/progression of the novel could be a bit off putting to some.</p>
