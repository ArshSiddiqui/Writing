I recall reading something in the preface/note that mentioned that Henchard was not a bad man, but that he is hot-tempered.

<p>5/5</p>
<p>Some potential spoilers ahead.</p>
<p>As with most classics, The Mayor of Casterbridge took me a while to read. The first half took a good
few weeks, but the second half was finished rather quickly.</p>
<p>I recall reading something in the preface/note that mentioned that Henchard was not a bad man, but that
he is hot-tempered. It was hard, for much of the novel, for me to understand why that statement was true,
why it was the case, but I seemed to then have forgotten something I recall now, that people can change.
This novel is the greatest example of the complexity of humans that I have thus far read. This book is very
effective in showing that we are not 1 dimensional beings with a set of non-malleable characteristics.</p>
<p>The full title of this novel, &ldquo;The Mayor of Casterbridge: A Story of a Man of Character&rdquo;, really fits the
theme of the story. What does it mean &ldquo;to have character&rdquo;? I&rsquo;ve done some quick Googling, but have gotten
many different answers: moral excellence and firmness or being able to deal well with difficult situations.
However, the best definitions, to me at least, discuss individuality, and how &ldquo;character&rdquo; just means the
sum of our traits. This means that you can have good character or bad character, they can all fall under
the same label, at least I suppose so (I&rsquo;m not a linguist, nor am I good at English).</p>
<p>To describe Henchard as a &ldquo;man of character&rdquo; is fitting to me, though with the definition I have given,
it fits all of us wouldn&rsquo;t it? I like how ambiguous this phrase is, though. It doesn&rsquo;t tell us much,
then, about Henchard, but effectively that he is just a person, like any of us. In that way, I guess we can
all perhaps see at least some of ourselves in Henchard (or maybe I just have problems that need to be resolved).</p>
<p>Forgive me for these poorly written ramblings. I have no qualifications in reading or writing, I just enjoy
thinking about it.</p>
<p>The book is fantastic, and if you want to read a story with characters that are just as complex, confusing,
and contrary to their own nature as real people are, then I would give this novel a read. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
