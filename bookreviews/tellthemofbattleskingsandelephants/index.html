I really enjoyed this book. It was, most of the time, an incredibly calming book that I found much enjoyment out of, which was surprising for me because I found it incredibly randomly. I discovered this book, mostly through its book cover, which was designed by the fantastic Peter Mendelsund. I happened to find the blurb on the book really interesting, and wasn&rsquo;t able to find much about it online, outside of some book reviews.">

<p><em>January 15, 2022</em></p>
<p>4/5</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. It was, most of the time, an incredibly calming book that I found much enjoyment
out of, which was surprising for me because I found it incredibly randomly. I discovered this book, mostly through
its book cover, which was designed by the fantastic Peter Mendelsund. I happened to find the blurb on the book
really interesting, and wasn&rsquo;t able to find much about it online, outside of some book reviews. Which immediately
made me interested.</p>
<p>The book is rather not that long, and many of the &ldquo;chapters&rdquo; are less than a page long. I say &ldquo;chapter&rdquo;, because
the book doesn&rsquo;t really have chapters in its normal sense, in fact, they are rather more like broken up processes
of thought or a change in viewpoints.</p>
<p>The prose is wonderful, and I frequently found myself very comforted by the way that Énard writes. It is a form
of writing that I cannot describe, or truly give any life to, but it was fantastic. To me, it really captured a
sense of calm and peace, which when mixed with the setting of Constantinople, really made me feel at home. I have
not felt this relaxed when reading a novel in a long time.</p>
<p>(Potential spoilers ahead.) The only downside to this book in my mind is the ending, which I found to be a bit
sudden, unexpected, and blocky. It may be perfectly acceptable to some, but I found it a bit too jarring when
compared to the rest of the book.</p>
<p>Overall, I found this to be an absolutely fantastic and lovely book, with a few chips in the glaze. I would
recommend this strongly to anybody who wants a calming, relaxing book that is quite thoughtful nonetheless. I
look forward to reading more from Mathias Énard in the future!</p>
