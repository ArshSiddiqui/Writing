I was told by a good friend that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all that it was chopped up to be, so I went in with little thought.\nI will say that the book began kind of slowly, but I enjoyed it all the same. At the halfway point, when the French Revolution begins is when the book really picks up steam, and it was at this point when I could not put the book down.\nPotential spoilers following\nSitting in history class learning about the French Revolution and the horrors of the Rein of Terror is one thing for certain. It is easy to throw around statistics of deaths of the time, but using statistics to represent deaths is unfair in some sense. This book really made me feel for all those lives lost and families unnecessarily impacted by the Revolution. The final chapter, and the final few paragraphs are truly something to behold, and left me a little sad I daresay.\nI highly recommend this read, it is a great book, there is no doubt about that in my mind.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/murderontheorientexpress/","title":"Murder on the Orient Express","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rMurder on the Orient Express\r#\rAgatha Christie\r#\rNovember 27, 2021\n5/5\nThe interesting thing about my reading schedule lately has been that I have been alternating between classic novels and Christie novels. I am a fairly slow reader so it\u0026rsquo;s always fun going from reading something like Don Quixote (which I greatly enjoyed but took me a good bit of months to read) to Christie\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;And Then There were None\u0026rdquo;, which I read in about two days and could not put down.\nI effectively had the same experience here, where before this, I was reading \u0026ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities\u0026rdquo;, by Charles Dickens, and then took a break from classic lit with some Christie. Again, this novel was spectacular; it was a novel I could not put down. The story is fascinating and I absolutely adore the setting of the plot (makes me wish trains were more ubiquitous in the USA). It is always a joy to read Christie and especially her stories with Poirot, and this is no exception.\nOne thing I would mention that is a bit out of the ordinary from the detective fiction I\u0026rsquo;ve read is the way this novel is set up. It isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily set up in the same vein as other detective fiction, but is rather broken down into a few sections: the case itself, meeting the passengers/dealing with evidence, and the ending. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen both the film adaptations of this novel, so actually reading it in this format (and with this set up) was rather interesting, though it does make sense from a deductive standpoint, I reckon.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this novel as I got great enjoyment out of it, but I do understand that the set up/progression of the novel could be a bit off putting to some.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/poemsofrome/","title":"Poems of Rome","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rPoems of Rome\r#\rKarl Kirchwey (Editor)\r#\rDecember 26, 2021\n3/5\nThis\u0026rsquo;ll be the first ever full book of poetry I\u0026rsquo;ve read, and the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve really considered the poetry I\u0026rsquo;m reading since high school English. Sure, I have read a fair bit of poetry since then, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t really taken the time to analyze it like I used to.\nOverall, this book was enjoyable. There were certainly poems I enjoyed, and the book did introduce me to Rainer Maria Rilke\u0026rsquo;s work, which I will certainly have to read more in the future, but there were also poems I just read for the sake of completion. While poems are certainly quite subjective, and I understand that my tastes may not match everyone else\u0026rsquo;s, I am still not a fan of having to churn through writing. Still though, of the poems I enjoyed, they were fantastically descriptive and lovely to read. I imagine that on a second read through of this book, I will feel more kindly to it (this isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that I hate it now - I don\u0026rsquo;t, I did enjoy it).\nOn the plus side, this is a book of poems, each one isn\u0026rsquo;t related to the other like a story (of course), so you can skip the one\u0026rsquo;s you do not like. You can read it at your leisure or at a very slow pace, even more so than with other books.\nI imagine that the best case reading scenario of this book would be to read it while on vacation in Rome. I googled many of the locations listed so I could understand what they looked like as I read it, but I imagine that reading each poem in their listed location would be far more gratifying than reading it in bed, like I did.\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes Rome (or is currently in Rome, be it living there or just visiting), maybe they have never been or perhaps they just want to visit it on a night in at home, or to anybody who is interested in Roman history, and would like to go more into depth in the literary history of it.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/writing/oldwriting/realprogrammersusegmail/","title":"Real Programmers Use Gmail","section":"Old Writing","content":"\rReal Programmers Use Gmail\r#\rI was recently having a conversation with a good friend of mine from the university. We were both students of the computer, or Computer Science majors as most people knew us by. During this conversation, I happened upon a question then that did intrigue me greatly: “What do you use to code?”.\nSee, this programmer (along with many others at my school) happen to use the IDE (the meaning of which doesn’t matter, but I DuckDuckGoed it, and it means Integrated Development Environment if you really care) of Eclipse.\nNow, I understand that the use of Eclipse is quite common among many programmers, and so too are many other IDEs, like Microsoft Visual Studio and WebStorm. However, I simply cannot allow the glorious realm of Computer Science to continue to stray down such a dark and gloomy and sad and disgusting and distressing and disappointing and path.\nI believe that IDEs are the mark of an inferior programmer, and only true programmers would use a system like Gmail to complete their code. There are many other ways of coding that I do find acceptable, like YouTube comments to private videos published by yourself or even by writing the code directly onto unlined and ungridded Tomoe River Paper using a Mont Blanc fountain pen containing the ink of various goats sacrificed to Steve Zuckerberg, but Gmail is a far more accessible and more efficient tool.\nTo explain my use of Gmail, I find it helpful to go through how I code, starting from the beginning.\nI begin with a cup of coffee, black preferably (because black coffee, as it does provide a taste much like dirt, allows me to regain my sense of feeling as a programmer), before sitting down in my gamer chair preparing myself to code. I use a gamer chair, because it is the only chair that can handle the strong and strenuous movements of anger and frustration I make when coding. To match my chair I have a Logitech G PRO Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Ultra Portable Tenkeyless Design, Detachable Micro USB Cable, 16.8 Million Color LIGHTSYNC RGB Backlit Keys (4.7 out of 5 stars, 1157 ratings), only the necessities.\nI then turn on my computer and enter “gmail.com” into the DuckDuckGo search bar. After providing my c\nredentials, I click on the compose button, but not after bragging to you (the reader), about my 17,345 unread emails (much of which is code previously created on Gmail). In the email construction box, I make sure that I put my own email address (GmailProgrammer4EVA2234@gmail.com) in the “To” section, to ensure that it goes to me, not to anybody else. In the subject line, I leave it blank, because I don’t have time to write out a subject line, I’m a busy programmer after all! After this, I generally find myself coffee-ed out, and so I take some of my caffeine pills (prescribed to me by me, not my doctor, because I don’t have the time to see doctors, I’m a busy programmer after all!) and pop about 5 pills into a bottle of water, and another 5 directly into my mouth, so as to chew them.\nThen I can finally begin to code, all within the text field, but sometimes, if I really feel like taking my programming prowess to the next level, I convert all of my paragraphs of code into one line and stick it in the subject field. This is a major feat within the world of computing, and so I make sure to additionally send an email with this subject line to my boss, with the additional message “Coming for your job next!!!1!11!1!”. When doing this, do make sure to consume as much caffeine as possible, as you don’t want to get tired whilst doing all that coding!\nAfter my work is done, I close my computer, before heading back to my kitchen to make another (well deserved) cup of black coffee.\nWhile it may seem like a lot of work, this is the true method of programming, and I hope that some of you lowly IDE programmers choose to enlighten yourselves and join me on this path.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/writing/bookreviews/romeoandjulliet/","title":"Romeo and Julliet","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rRomeo and Julliet\r#\rWilliam Shakespeare\r#\rFebruary 19, 2022\n4/5\nGiven the many varying reviews of this novel that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen here, I was curious to see what I\u0026rsquo;d think of it after having finished reading the story. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know a lot about the story beforehand (besides whatever is in the public consciousness), and it\u0026rsquo;d taken me long enough to get round to the book, so I dived right on it.\nSome slight spoilers ahead.\nOverall, I enjoyed the book. The main downside I found in the book was the unbelievableness in some aspects of the story, like how excessively quickly Romeo and Juliet decided they loved each other, and things along those lines. I figured, after reading such things as that, that I would find the book unfavorable, mostly in how quickly an attempt was made to push the two together, but I found that Shakespeare did it fantastically and made the whole idea seem reasonable.\nMany facets of the book were absolutely lovely to read. Going in, I was sure that I would have trouble understanding what was going on, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t that bad at all, the writing and speech do become rather melodic. The famous scenes of when Romeo first meets Juliet and when he speaks to her from her window were absolutely fantastic example of how nice the speech was to read. Their individual lines flowing from one character to another was done with such cleanliness that I genuinely felt the need to read it out loud, so as to get a better experience of the writing.\nI highly recommend this book to pretty much any reader. There is a reason it is so famous and it is an absolute delight to read.

One of the main reasons for this choice, outside of what I had just outlined, is that using the Pandas library allows us to quickly and easily gain stock information for a given stock for a period of time.\nfrom pandas_datareader import data\rimport datetime\rtoday = datetime.date.today()\rstart_date = str(today - datetime.timedelta(1000))\rend_date = str(today)\rpanel_data = data.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)\rpanel_data\rDate High Low Open Close Volume Adj Close 2019-08-28 51.430000 50.830002 51.025002 51.382500 63755200.0 50.340683 2019-08-29 52.330002 51.665001 52.125000 52.252499 83962000.0 51.193043 2019-08-30 52.612499 51.799999 52.540001 52.185001 84573600.0 51.126915 2019-09-03 51.744999 51.055000 51.607498 51.424999 80092000.0 50.382324 2019-09-04 52.369999 51.830002 52.097500 52.297501 76752400.0 51.237133 \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2022-05-17 149.770004 146.679993 148.860001 149.240005 78336300.0 149.240005 2022-05-18 147.360001 139.899994 146.850006 140.820007 109742900.0 140.820007 2022-05-19 141.660004 136.600006 139.880005 137.350006 136095600.0 137.350006 2022-05-20 140.699997 132.610001 139.089996 137.589996 137194600.0 137.589996 2022-05-23 143.259995 137.649994 137.789993 143.110001 116301300.0 143.110001 With this data gained, we can quickly single out the Close column such that we can start visualizing our stock data. Sometimes when looking at stock data, or when visualizing it, we may want to smooth out the data so that we can avoid shifted perceptions due to temporary changes in stock valuation. This may offer us a more comprehensive look at our data, that is not skewed by any minor blip.\nWe can change the duration of the rolling average, based upon how much smoothing we may want. For example, we could have a shorter smoothing of just 20 days, or longer smoothing of 100 days.\nBefore I did that, though, I first had to reindex my data. Because financial data is collected on weekdays, I had to account for that fact by adding in all of the non-included days in our data between the start and end dates we provided. We can fill these empty spots in with na and then we can reindex those to copy the previously entered piece of data into that box.\nimport pandas as pd\rimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\rclose = panel_data['Close']\rall_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='B')\rclose = close.reindex(all_weekdays)\rclose = close.fillna(method='ffill')\rshort_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=20).mean()\rlong_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=100).mean()\rfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9))\rax.plot(close.index, close, label='AAPL')\rax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label='20 days rolling')\rax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label='100 days rolling')\rax.set_xlabel('Date')\rax.set_ylabel('Adjusted closing price ($)')\rax.legend()\rWhen developing a stock strategy, or trading strategy, we will want to analyze the change in the returns of our stock over time. One way to do this would be to look at relative returns. A relative return is the amount of return our stock will get after some timeline relative to some benchmark return. The formula for relative returns looks as follows.\n\\[\rr_{relative}(t) = \\frac{p(t) - p(t - 1)}{p(t - 1)}\r\\]\rAnother way to do this would be through logarithmic returns, the formula which is as follows.\n\\[\rr(t) = log(\\frac{p(t)}{p(t - 1)})\r\\]\rThere are many reasons why we may wish to use a log return, rather than relative returns, some of which would be that they capture the compounding effect. When we consider that financial investments such as these are compounded over many points in time, we may find this compounding important to capture in our data, which make log returns more appealing in their use.\nimport numpy as np\rlog_returns = np.log(close).diff()\rfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(16, 12))\rax1.plot(log_returns.index, log_returns.cumsum(), label='AAPL')\rax1.set_ylabel('Cumulative log returns')\rax1.set_xlabel('Date')\rax1.legend(loc='upper left')\rax2.plot(log_returns.index, 100*(np.exp(log_returns.cumsum()) - 1), label='AAPL')\rax2.set_ylabel('Total relative returns (%)')\rax2.set_xlabel('Date')\rax2.legend(loc='upper left')\rplt.show()\rWhile analyzing our data visually is indeed very useful, it is also helpful to analyze our data quantitatively.

This method is evidently fairly easy to create, and shows us the general trend of our stock movement. Another method is known as the \u0026ldquo;exponential moving average\u0026rdquo; (EMA). This method of moving average places more importance/weight on more recent data points, so it accounts more strongly for recent changes in price.\nWith the EMA, we can also do it across a time period, perhaps 20 or even 100 days.

It can be calculated as the standard deviation between returns of the stock.

I say \u0026ldquo;chapter\u0026rdquo;, because the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have chapters in its normal sense, in fact, they are rather more like broken up processes of thought or a change in viewpoints.\nThe prose is wonderful, and I frequently found myself very comforted by the way that Énard writes. It is a form of writing that I cannot describe, or truly give any life to, but it was fantastic. To me, it really captured a sense of calm and peace, which when mixed with the setting of Constantinople, really made me feel at home. I have not felt this relaxed when reading a novel in a long time.\n(Potential spoilers ahead.) The only downside to this book in my mind is the ending, which I found to be a bit sudden, unexpected, and blocky. It may be perfectly acceptable to some, but I found it a bit too jarring when compared to the rest of the book.\nOverall, I found this to be an absolutely fantastic and lovely book, with a few chips in the glaze.
